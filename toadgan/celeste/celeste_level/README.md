# Celeste Map image encoding

Allows reading Celeste maps and transforming them into simple images (where each color represents a type of entity / solids).
Currently ignores backgrounds, visual-only entities, as well as some entities crucial for some maps.

Used for obtaining data for creating GANs on Celeste levels.
